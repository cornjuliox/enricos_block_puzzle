# About This Project
I wanted to learn how Pygame worked, so I built this little Tetris clone with the help of a Youtube tutorial.

I'm interested in tacking on improvements to this thing, starting with the GUI. 

Absolute positioning sucks.

# Requirements
- Python 3.10.4
- pygame-ce 2.4.0

Just `pip install -r requirements.txt` and then `python main.py` in the Project directory to get it going.

# Controls
- Left and right arrow keys to move blocks side-to-side
- Up arrow key to rotate blocks.
- Down arrow key to move blocks down, i.e speed up falling. There is no 'drop' button (yet).
